## Overview

The Complete Strength Protocol is a structured, full-body strength training program designed for maximum efficiency and minimal cognitive overhead. It enforces strict hygiene standards (no floor contact), automatic progression, recovery-based scaling, and built-in deload cycles.

### Core Principles

- **Schedule:** 3 days/week (e.g., Mon/Wed/Fri)
- **Duration:** 65 minutes hard cap
- **Rest Between Sessions:** 48-72 hours minimum
- **Hygiene Protocol:** All exercises are Standing, Seated, or Bench-based (no floor contact)

## Progression System

### Automatic Progression
- **+5 lbs** added on successful set completion
- **2.5 lb** micro-loading available for finer adjustments
- Progression tracked independently for each exercise

### Deload Protocol
- **Automatic deload every 6 weeks**
- Deload weight = **60% of max**
- Prevents overtraining and breaks through plateaus

### Stall Detection
- Triggers after **3 consecutive failed sessions** at the same weight
- Automatic weight reduction to **90%** on stall detection
- Allows progression to resume from a more manageable load

### Plate Math
Standard Olympic barbell (45 lbs) with available plates:
- 45, 35, 25, 10, 5, 2.5, 1.25 lbs

## Recovery-Based Scaling

Before each workout, assess your recovery status:

| Status | Criteria | Action |
|--------|----------|--------|
| **GREEN** (Full Strength) | 7+ hours sleep, no pain, feeling good | 100% of recommended weight |
| **YELLOW** (Moderate Recovery) | 5-6 hours sleep, stiffness present | 90% of recommended weight |
| **RED** (Poor Recovery) | <5 hours sleep, acute pain, illness | **No lifting allowed** - Rest day |

### Red Day Recommendation
Take a 20-30 minute walk instead. Light movement aids recovery without adding stress. Return when recovery improves.

---

## Fault Tolerance Rules

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| **Missed 1 workout** | Slide schedule (maintain 48h gap between sessions) |
| **Missed 2+ workouts** | Reduce weights by 10% |
| **Sick (Fever)** | FULL REST. Resume 24h after fever breaks. Reduce weights by 20% |
| **Injury** | Skip aggravating exercise. Continue with others. |
| **Gym Closed** | Execute Emergency Bodyweight Circuit (see below) |

---

## Emergency Bodyweight Circuit

**When the gym is unavailable.**

**Format:** 4 Rounds, AMRAP (As Many Reps As Possible), 90 seconds rest between rounds

| Movement Pattern | Exercise |
|------------------|----------|
| Push | Incline Push-ups (Hands on furniture) |
| Legs | Bodyweight Squats (Tempo: 3s down) |
| Pull | Inverted Rows (Table) OR Door Rows |
| Core | Hardstyle Plank |
